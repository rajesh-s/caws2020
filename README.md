## About

The goal of Computer Architecture Winter School (CAWS 2020) is to provide an introduction to Computer Architecture and related areas to undergraduate students who have undergone basic training in computer organization. This 4-day winter school will feature speakers from IISc, IIT Kanpur, Ashoka University, etc. In addition to the lectures, the winter school will focus on hands-on sessions where attendees will spend a substantial amount of time experimenting with architectural tools and simulators. CAWS 2020 will also feature speakers from the industry.

Applications for participation are invited from students (undergraduates and early-career graduate students) who are interested in pursuing higher studies (Mastersâ€™ or Ph.D.) in the areas of computer systems. This winter school will not only help understand computer architecture basics but also help prepare for taking advanced courses and get started with research.

The organizers are planning on admitting approximately 100 students for the winter school. The selection process is going to be extremely competitive, so please apply soon!

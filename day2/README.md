## DRAM architecture, related performance issues and optimizations: Vivek Seshadri

- Memory is the critical bottleneck/ central point to the idea of Von Neumann architectures
- SSD is not a technology rather than implementation. Flash is the underlying technology. Similarly, DRAM (tech), HBM (implementation)
- We are striving to get to a memory that takes the best of all worlds. Cost is driven by density

- DRAM ecosystem is unique. Memory controller is made by companies like Intel, but Memory manufacturing happens by someone else

- Memory controller handles FR-FCFS or other scheduling queues
